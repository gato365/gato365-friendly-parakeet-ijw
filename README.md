The ability to generate password for a lonely user

The purpose of this project is to generate a password based on a user's preferences.


*Disclaimer: This project was very challenging. However, it allowed me to see things in multiple ways, and I sincerely appreciate this task and all that I've been able to learn from this project and the teacher and tutoring staff.* (**SHOUT OUT TO :Robert Wijtman, Welsey Clemets, Donnahue George)**

My approach can be seen in the below figure. This is what I would traditionally do if I was programming in Python or even R using their built-in API to build.

This caused more headaches than expected. After seeing the video posted regarding how to use prompts and alerts, I sincerely thought it would be a better idea for me to switch my method, but I believe in learning, and I sure did.


## Section A - Defining Character Arrays

 This is where I define all possibilites based on the 4 types of info.
 
## Section B - Getting Information from user
<img src = "/assets/images/section-B.jpg " width="25%" height="45%">  

This is where I am getting info from user.

## Section C - Function to Generate Password (Part i)

This is where I am determining if I should add possible chars based on user preferences.

## Section C - Function to Generate Password (Part ii)
<img src = "/assets/images/section-c-part-ii.jpg" width="25%" height="45%"> 

This is where I random select numbers to create a password based possible chars from user.

## Section D -  Botton to Listen to site
<img src = "/assets/images/section-D.jpg" width="25%" height="45%">          

This is where I am calling the appropriate functions to generate a password based on user info.


## HTML Modification to HTML for checkboxes

This is where I made checkboxes for the user to check if they want it in the password.
